# Capstone Project 2
## Movie recommendation System

### Introduction
Everyone loves movies irrespective of age, gender, race, color, or geographical location. We all in a way are connected to each other via this amazing medium. Yet what most interesting is the fact that how unique our choices and combinations are in terms of movie preferences. Some people like genre-specific movies be it a thriller, romance, or sci-fi, while others focus on lead actors and directors. When we take all that into account, it's astoundingly difficult to generalize a movie and say that everyone would like it. But with all that said, it is still seen that similar movies are liked by a specific part of the society.

So here's where we as data scientists come into play and extract the juice out of all the behavioral patterns of not only the audience but also from the movies themselves. So without further ado let's jump right into the basics of a recommendation system.

### Aim
To build a solution that should able to recommend the movies based on the content and tags of the movie.

### Goal
The primary goal of recommendation systems is to help users find what they want based on their preferences and previous interactions.
Providing related content out of relevant and irrelevant collection of items to users of online service providers.

### Process and Workflow
- Data preparation: download, parse, import and prepare the data to be processed and analysed.
- Data exploration and visualization: explore data to understand the features and the relationship between the features and predictors.
- Data cleaning & Preprocessing: eventually the dataset contains unnecessary information that needs to be removed.
- Data analysis and modeling: create the model using the insights gained during exploration. Also test and validate the model.
- Communicate: create the report and publish the results
